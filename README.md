With an expertise in data science and machine learning, I have a keen interest in marketing and product UX design. My experience encompasses a range of data science projects, including behavioral marketing and data-driven UX optimization, spanning various stages of the project lifecycle, from ideation and data processing to model development and MLOps.

Proficient in technical stacks such as Python/SQL, GCP (VertexAI, BigQuery, Data Studio), AWS (SageMaker, Redshift), and PowerBI, I am well-equipped to manage and deliver data science projects of varying complexities.

Lately I have been heavily involved in building apps on top of Large Language Models using LangChain and LLamaIndex

Beyond data science, I have been intrigued by blockchain technology and its potential use cases, particularly after reflecting on Bitcoin's impact on money, ownership, value, governance, and fairness. I'm navigating this space using different lenses, including fundamentals, technicals, trading bots, and on-chain analytics. This is a learning journey that I am committed to, and I am eager to see where it takes me.

Apart from my technical pursuits, I have a passion for philosophy and languages and welcome any opportunity to explore quirky questions.
