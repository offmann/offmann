With an expertise in data science and machine learning, I have a keen interest in marketing and product UX design. My experience encompasses a range of data science projects, including behavioral marketing and data-driven UX optimization, spanning various stages of the project lifecycle, from ideation and data processing to model development and MLOps.

Proficient in technical stacks such as Python/SQL, GCP (VertexAI, BigQuery, Data Studio), AWS (SageMaker, Redshift), and PowerBI, I am well-equipped to manage and deliver data science projects of varying complexities.

In the last year, I have been heavily involved in building apps on top of LLMs : semantic search engines, text-to-sql, retrieval augmented generation

Apart from my technical pursuits, I have a passion for philosophy and languages and welcome any opportunity to explore quirky questions.
