My main area of expertise is data science / machine learning.  
I worked mostly on DS projects for behavioural marketing : predictions, clustering and nlp. 
I have been involved in different stages of projects lifecycle : use cases ideation, data gathering, model development, mlops & to a lesser degree CI/CD (as it's an emergent interest). 
Technical stack : python/sql, hortonworks, aws, gcp. 

In a parallel life, I'm excited about blockchain technology and its different uses cases.  
My involvement (for now) consists on managing a personal portfolio and navigating the "cryptoverse" with different lenses : fundamentals, technicals, trading bots, on-chain analytics...etc. I keep on learning about these topics everyday. This journey is young (started 1 year ago), let's see where I land.  

Outside of ML and the cryptoverse, I like philosophy and languages and I don't mind silly questions.
